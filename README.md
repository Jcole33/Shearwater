# Shearwater VR Pilot Interface Senior Design Project 2021

This project was made to create a VR Pilot Interface that would integrate with the Shearwater UAV drone utilizing Mission Planner and the Ricoh Theta V camera.
For detailed specifications check the Shearwater 2021 Senior Design thesis.

If work continues on this project there are 2 things to note to get it working again:
1) Make sure to read through the User Manual Appendix in the Thesis Report. Specifically note the Mission Planner setup and the IP.txt file.
2) The google api key will need to be replaced in Assets/MyScripts/GoogleMap.cs 

I have left comments in a few places where I think improvements could be made, but feel free to reach out for questions or suggestions at Jcole@scu.edu.
